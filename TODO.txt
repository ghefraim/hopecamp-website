For now:
    - loading gif on all pages


Final touches:
    - not a bug cuz it works: auth tracking works but itâ€™s kinda lame. only works after page loads.
    - keyword: architecture
    - back button - FORGOT
    - signup -> required fields
    - signup -> reguli
    - MyAccount EDIT?

    - integrate Attendance (the python proj should do the job, but i have to change some things; also see if scanner works)
    - TEST different behaviour on signup/myacc...


    ---currentURL variable is very wierd...
