For now:
    - finalize inscrie-te.html
        - generate QR.jpg, store it in Storage & database
    - finalize myaccount.html
    - finalize aboutus.html



Final touches:
    - not a bug cuz it works: auth tracking works but itâ€™s kinda lame. only works after page loads.
    - keyword: architecture
    - back button - FORGOT
    - signup -> required fields
    - signup -> reguli
    - MyAccount EDIT?

    - integrate Attendance (the python proj should do the job, but i have to change some things; also see if scanner works)
    - TEST different behaviour on signup/myacc...
