For now:
    - #card not centered...
        - centered on index, copy that to the others

    - index> enter.keypress=login btn

BUGS:
    - it automatically signs me out (phone)
    - end-date (signup.css) nu arata cum trebuie

    - make card height dependent on last element.
        - overflow auto? sau ajustare manuala (schimb heightul pe click)

    - Safari doesn't limit date input

    - data popup has left margin  
    

Final touches:
    - NETOPIA Payments (nu)

    - font!

    - OPTIONAL banner (logo, aboutus) 

    - everywhere > logo in tab icon

    - myaccount (v. tabara) > if !payed show. 

    - when getting to admins, i have to check if user has admin (someone might see go to /admins manually but they have to be signed in with admins priv.)

    - DIACRITICE

    - EDIT DATABASE RULES (hide firebase secrets! - nu e problema ca api_key e public. Should edit rules)

    - reorganize files (login-index)

    - back button - FORGOT pass

    - signup -> reguli

    - remove .html from URL

    - versetul zilei? in myaccount/login screen

    - countdown timer in login?

    - card width on desktop bigger

    - integrate Attendance (the python proj should do the job, but i have to change some things; also see if scanner works)
    nope. make it in admins. with js

    - TEST different behaviour on signup/myacc...
