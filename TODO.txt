For now:
    - signup 
        - color animation on button when checkbox checked
    - card-adjuster for every html? or find a better way (actually iy's about zoom not about card width)
    - make card height dependent on last element.
    - after sending message, make it unavailable

    - 'myAccount' update (forma de "in tabarA")


Final touches:
    - not a bug cuz it works: auth tracking works but itâ€™s kinda lame. only works after page loads.
    - keyword: architecture
    - back button - FORGOT
    - signup -> required fields
    - signup -> reguli
    - MyAccount EDIT?

    - integrate Attendance (the python proj should do the job, but i have to change some things; also see if scanner works)
    - TEST different behaviour on signup/myacc...


    ---currentURL variable is very wierd... but working so dont break it XD
